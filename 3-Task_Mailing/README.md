## 4. Deployment and Setup Notes
- Shared Google Sheet: The workflow relies on the sheet with ID of your `Document` having a column titled "Assigned to" to successfully filter the tasks.

- Efficiency Note: The workflow retrieves all rows from the Google Sheet twice at the start. For efficiency in future updates, consider fetching the data once and using the Split In Batches node before applying two separate Filter nodes.

- Credentials: The required Gmail and Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials (YOUR_CREDENTIALS) must be configured in n8n.
