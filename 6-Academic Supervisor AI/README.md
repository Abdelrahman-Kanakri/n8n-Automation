The AI Agent is configured with a multi-step protocol to ensure a comprehensive academic plan is generated.

### Key Steps and Requirements

| Step                  | Requirement                                                                 | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Information Collection** | Collect Major, Current Academic Year, and completed/in-progress courses. | Must validate inputs and ask for missing information before proceeding. |
| **Academic Analysis** | Identify core/required courses and check prerequisites for each course.     | Exclude courses the student cannot register for yet.                  |
| **Study Plan Proposal** | Propose a list of recommended courses (core + electives).                  | The plan must be balanced (credit hours, course diversity), with short notes explaining why each course is recommended. |
| **Course Tree**       | Build an academic course pathway (Course Tree) showing hierarchical relationships (prerequisites/follow-up courses). | Helps students understand long-term academic planning.                |
| **Reference Source**  | Must use Idaho State Universityâ€™s official course catalog as the primary reference for all recommendations. | Ensures recommendations are accurate and official.                     |
| **Final Confirmation**| Chat until the student confirms their course selections, and collect their full name and contact information (phone number or student ID). | Completes the advising workflow.                                      |




4. Deployment and Setup Notes
- AI Model: The workflow uses the Gemini 2.5 Pro chat model.

- Memory: The Simple Memory node uses the Telegram Chat ID (={{ $json.message.chat.id }}) to ensure the AI Agent remembers the context of the conversation for each individual student.

- Required Credentials: This workflow requires credentials for the Telegram API and the Google Gemini (PaLM) API.

- Usage: The workflow is triggered by an incoming message to the linked Telegram bot.
